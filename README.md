# COMPSCI4077
 This is the source code for my Level 4 Coursework for the Web Science module (COMPSCI4077).

Data crawled was initially stored in MongoDB and then extracted into a JSON file for sample data to be provided in order to run the code.

The repository consists of 2 folders:
- Report
- Source Code

The Source Code folder contains the python files implemented to carry out all tasks required and the plots and outputs from each one in subfolders. 

In order to be able to run the code:
1) cd SourceCode
2) Install dependencies by running: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3) To run Streaming API run: `python3 1a_streamingAPI.py`
4) To run REST API run for enhanced data collection: `python3 1b_restAPI.py`
5) To run all the data analysis again with the sample_data.json provided and produce relevant output as stated in the report:  `python3 2_3_4.py True`
